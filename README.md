# AI ImageVoice: Advanced Text, Image Retrieval, and Voiceover Script
AI ImageVoice is a Python project with three modules: `bing.py` for Bing image searches, `downloader.py` to manage image downloads, and `main.py` integrating OpenAI's API for image processing and voiceover generation. It fetches images based on text prompts and creates audio descriptions, offering a multimodal AI experience.
